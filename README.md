# Robocon2016

## Overview
**ABU ROBOCON** (Asia-Pacific Robot Contest) is an annual robotics competition held among several countries in the Asia Pacific demographic.  
In the competition robots compete to complete a task within a set period of time. To build the robots, contestants, who are restricted to be *undergraduate students*, must possess rich knowledge in **programming**, **mechanical design** and **electronic circuit design**.  
ROBOCON 2016 was held at Bangkok, Thailand. The theme was "Clean Energy Recharging the World". The concept behind the theme is the utilization of renewable energy sources.

## Problem Statement
The problem statement has been added to the git repository. It required the construction of two different robots:  
**Eco Bot**  
This is a small bot that has no actuators of its own. Its job to to transport a propeller from one end of the field to the other by traversing a path simulating hills, rivers and slopes. The path consists of many sharp turns and steep sloped which make it difficult for the eco bot to manoeuvre. As the eco bot has no motor or piston to provide thrust, it must rely on the second bot to power it along the path.  
**Hybrid Bot**  
This is a much larger bot that has two basic tasks. The first is to provide means to power the eco bot through the terrain with the catch that the hybrid bot is not allowed to physically touch the eco bot at any time. The second task is to obtain the propeller from the eco bot when the eco bot has traversed the terrain and then must climb a pole to attach the propeller on the pole at a height of 2 meters above the ground. This proved to be a difficult task provided that the hybrid bot weights close to 15 kg.
